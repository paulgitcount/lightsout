# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

- Lights out
- Pitch room
- Dark Bulb

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A point and click escape room game where you are a dark room. The room also changes if you try to turn on the lights

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

For my final project I want to make a point and click escape game, in this game you are stuck in a dark room with seemingly no way out, you can see that there is a lightbulb but every time you try and turn on the lights every thing in the room changes. I will try and use python as my software. It will have some puzzles, some Items, and some theme for the room thats in the dark. As of now I will try and keep it simple, if I had time a could add more features but right now I'm keeping it simple.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Mutliple Ending, a Couple more enviroments for the room, and a few jumpscares.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I'm not sure how to start. I guess i'll start with the room, then find a way to transition the different environments of said room.
